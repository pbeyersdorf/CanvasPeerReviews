{% import 'macros.txt' as macros %}
A weighted average of the reviews of your work give the following scores:
<ul>
{% for cid in assignment.criteria_ids(): %}{#
#}<li>{{pointsByCriteria[cid]}} for '{{criteriaDescription[cid]}}'
{% endfor %}{#
#}</ul>    

Earning you {{creationGrade}}% for your submission.

Compared to reviews by {{ macros.compared_to(assignment) }}, the peer review scores you gave others deviated by
{{ macros.review_feedback_by_criteria(student,assignment,criteriaDescription) }}
{{ macros.comment_on_reviews(student,assignment) }}

{%if student.amountReviewed(assignment) <1 and student.amountReviewed(assignment) >0%}{#
#}You only completed {{"{0:0.f}".format(student.amountReviewed(assignment)*100)}}% of the reviews you were assigned so the score on your completed reviews was reduced by this percentage to determine your grade  
{%endif%}
Earning you {{reviewGrade}}% for your reviews.   

When your submission and review scores are combined you have a grade of {{rawGrade}}%{{macros.comment_if_curved(student,assignment) }} ({{curvedPoints}} points).<p>

If you believe the score assigned to your creation is not an accurate reflection of your work, explain in a comment in the next few days and include the word '{{keywordCreation}}' to have it regraded.

{%if assignment.reviewScoreMethod == "calibrated grading":%}
If you believe your review grade does not correspond to the quality of your peer reviewing, you can request to have it recalculated using only comparisons to my reviews.  To have it recalculated enter a comment with the word '{{keywordReview}}' in it.
