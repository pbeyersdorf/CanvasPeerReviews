# 	general feedback for creation and reviews with calibrated review grading
###############################################################################
A weighted average of the reviews of your work give the following scores:
    {points_by_criteria} for '{description_by_criteria}'

Compared to reviews by the instructor and other students, the peer review scores you gave others deviated by
{review feedback by criteria}
{comment on review}

You earned {creationGrade}% for your submission and {reviewGrade}% for your reviews.   When combined this gives you {rawGrade}%.  {comment if grades are curved} ({curvedPoints} points).

If you believe the score assigned to your creation is not an accurate reflection of your work, explain in a comment in the next few days and include the word '{keywordCreation}' to have it regraded.

If you believe your review grade does not correspond to the quality of your peer reviewing, you can request to have it recalculated using only comparisons to my reviews.  To have it recalculated enter a comment with the word '{keywordReview}' in it.
