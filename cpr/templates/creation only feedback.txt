A weighted average of the reviews of your work give the following scores:
<ul>
{% for cid in assignment.criteria_ids(): %}{#
#}	<li>{{pointsByCriteria[cid]}} for '{{criteriaDescription[cid]}}'
{% endfor %}{#
#}</ul>    
You earned {{ creationGrade }}% for your submission{{ macros.comment_if_curved(student,assignment) }}  ({{ creationPoints }} points).<p>

If you believe the score assigned to your creation is not an accurate reflection of your work, explain in a comment in the next few days and include the word '{{keywordCreation}}' to have it regraded.
